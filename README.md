# RotR Color Fixer

This is a tiny lightweight program which swaps color channels to be compatible with RotR color markings.

Its aim is to allow you to work on your marking files in their correct color, then do a one-step use of this program just before you send your marking for upload.

This will also convert *back*, so you can undo the color corrections you've already done, and get back to the colors you intend so you can work more easily. Converting an image twice gives you what you started with.

To use:

* Save [the executable](https://github.com/HurrenCodes/RotR_Colorfix/releases/download/1.0.0-alpha/RotR_Colorfix.exe) to some location in your files.

* Drag your marking image onto the executable.

* That's it! A converted file will appear next to the original.

* To make it easier, you can create shortcuts to the executable, or even move it to your task bar if you wish - then just drag your file onto the icon or shortcut.

## BE AWARE!!!
The program stores the color-converted version of `your file` in `your file__Converted.png`.

If you already have a file called `your file__Converted.png` then **IT WILL BE OVERWRITTEN!!!**

This is so that you don't have to accept the overwrite each time you modify your marking

This project is really just a little temporary stopgap while all the awesome work is being done behind the scenes on their beautiful, incredible project.

Thank you!
